Don't feel sorry for me. I may be blind, but my nose is still working at 100%. Smell is a powerful sense to us dogs. My "sniffer" as almost as important to me as your eyes are to you.

However, you may need to help me a little. Keep me on a short leash so I don't wander into traffic. Stop when there are steps or curbs that I have to step up or down on and let me get my bearings first.

Finally, give me lots of TLC(Tender Loving Care). You'd do that anyway, wouldn't you? So you see, blindness is not such a big deal for me - as long as I have you in my life!

Did you know dogs rely on their sense of smell?

We older dogs have to go to the bathroom more often then when we were younger. Frequently I need to wake up my human mommy or daddy during the night so they can let me outside to go potty. I'm so glad they understand and don't get mad at me or make me wait a long time to go out.

Some people say, "My dog can hold it for hours and hours." Maybe they can, but it sure is NOT comfortable!

Yum Yum! We hear antifreeze smells wonderful and tastes really sweet - so it would be very tempting to try some. But it's also very poisonous; many dogs and cats have died after licking only an itsy bit off a street or driveway.

Please ask your mmom and dad to store antifreeze away from your pet. And always check to make sure none has leaked from the car. Or better yet, ask your parents to buy the new brands that don't smell or taste as good to us. Their car will run just fine - and so will we. Thank you!

some people say your dog is healthy if his nose is cool and moist...but that's not necessarily true. What's going on inside of him is even more important. Don't stop at his nose, but also look in his mouth for nice pink gums (not blue-ish)

Also make sure that his eyes are clear and that there are no yellow spots on the inside of his ears. This is a sign of a possible infection...or something worse. Bad breath and runny poop are also things to look for. Keep an eye out for these symptoms in your dog!
